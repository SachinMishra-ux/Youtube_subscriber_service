## To deploy your scripts so that anyone can authenticate and you can fetch their YouTube data, you need to set up OAuth 2.0 for your application. Here are the steps you need to follow:

### Set Up OAuth 2.0 in Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console.
2. Select your project or create a new one.
3. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.
4. Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
5. Configure the consent screen by providing the necessary information.
6. Select the application type (e.g., Web application) and configure the redirect URIs.
7. Download the client_secret.json file and keep it secure.
8. Update Your Script to Use OAuth 2.0:

9. Modify your script to handle the OAuth 2.0 flow and store the credentials securely.
10. Ensure that the client_secret.json file is included in your .gitignore to avoid exposing it in version control.

### Deploy Your Application:

1. Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud Platform).
2. Deploy your application and ensure it is accessible to users.
Handle User Authentication:

3.  When a user accesses your application, redirect them to the Google OAuth 2.0 consent screen.
4.  After the user grants permission, store their credentials securely and use them to access their YouTube data.
